- [X] jsEngine was set back to Hermes in app.json after switching to mock authentication. Revisit this if real Firebase Auth is reintroduced or if native module compatibility issues arise.
- [X] Hermes was disabled in app.json (set jsEngine to 'jsc') to allow Firebase Auth to work in Expo Go. If you need Hermes or native Firebase features in the future, revisit this decision and consider migrating to a custom dev client or bare workflow.
