# SurfSUP App To-Do List

This document maintains a running list of tasks, enhancements, bug fixes, and technical debt items for the SurfSUP application.

## ðŸŽ¯ Major Milestone Achieved: Sophisticated Lake Superior Surf Forecasting System

**Status: COMPLETED** âœ…

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive, production-ready surf forecasting system specifically designed for Lake Superior conditions. This system includes:

- **Multi-source data aggregation** from NOAA Weather.gov, NOAA Marine Products, NDBC Buoys, and Windy API
- **Lake Superior-specific surf likelihood calculations** with conservative wave height gates
- **Spot-specific wind direction logic** for North Shore vs South Shore spots (Park Point, Lester, Stoney, Brighton, Marquette, Ashland, etc.)
- **Sophisticated wind logic** that separates swell-building winds from local grooming winds
- **Intelligent rating adjustments** based on wind quality (clean, onshore, strong)
- **Advanced data processing** with floating-point precision fixes and realistic wave height ranges
- **Clean architecture** with single source of truth for all wind logic

**Code Quality**: Resolved 58 linting issues, eliminated duplicate code, and improved maintainability to production standards.

- [X] jsEngine was set back to Hermes in app.json after switching to mock authentication. Revisit this if real Firebase Auth is reintroduced or if native module compatibility issues arise.
- [X] Hermes was disabled in app.json (set jsEngine to 'jsc') to allow Firebase Auth to work in Expo Go. If you need Hermes or native Firebase features in the future, revisit this decision and consider migrating to a custom dev client or bare workflow.
